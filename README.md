## Data Structure
A data structure is a way of organising data so that it can be used effectively.

They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help to manage and organize data. They make code cleaner and easier to understand. 
## Big O (Growth rate)
Big O, denoted by O(n), is the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size.


log(n) 
log(40) = log(2*20) = log2 + log20

For large n 

O(1) => O(log n) => O(sqrt(n)) => O(n) => O(n log n) => O(n^2)  => O(2^n) => O(log n!) => O(n^n)


Examples 
O(n) - linear search
O(log n) - Binary search
O(n log n ) - Marge sort 

O(n!) - Traveling salesman
##

Arrays =>  Ordered list of data where duplicates are allowed
Sets =>  Unordered list of data where duplicates are not allowed
Object =>  key-value pairs of unordered data 
Maps => key-value pairs of ordered, iterable data.

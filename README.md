## Big O (Growth rate)
Big O, denoted by O(n), is the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size.


log(n) 
log(40) = log(2*20) = log2 + log20

For large n 

O(1) => O(log n) => O(sqrt(n)) => O(n) => O(n log n) => O(n^2)  => O(2^n) => O(log n!) => O(n^n)


Examples 
O(n) - linear search
O(log n) - Binary search
O(n log n ) - Marge sort 

O(n!) - Traveling salesman
